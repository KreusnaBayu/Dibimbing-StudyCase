This project is built using Express.js, a fast and minimalist Node.js web framework, to handle the server-side logic. It uses RESTful APIs to manage the communication between the front-end and the server.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Node.js (Ensure that Node.js is installed on your system)
npm (Node package manager, usually comes with Node.js)
Installation
Clone this repository:

bash
Salin kode
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Salin kode
cd your-repo-name
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Salin kode
npm install
Running the Server
To start the server, use the following command:

bash
Salin kode
npm start
The server will be up and running on the specified port (by default, it runs on http://localhost:3000). You can configure the port in the .env file.

API Endpoints
This project uses RESTful API principles. Below is a list of available endpoints:

GET /api/resource - Fetches all resources.
GET /api/resource/:id - Fetches a single resource by ID.
POST /api/resource - Creates a new resource.
PUT /api/resource/:id - Updates an existing resource by ID.
DELETE /api/resource/:id - Deletes a resource by ID.

Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory to manage environment-specific settings, such as port number and database configuration.
Example .env file in envcopy
